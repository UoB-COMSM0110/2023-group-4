# Introduction
In this game, the player takes on the role of a brave cat that must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach its ultimate goal. With quick reflexes and agility, the cat must leap and dodge its way through daily challenges and unexpected twists of fate.
Throughout its journey, the cat faces new obstacles. However, the cat's greatest challenge is a copycat that threatens to steal its place in life's grand design.

While the cat's attempts to overcome this challenge may initially result in defeat, quitting is not an option. Every time the player tries to quit, they are met with even greater challenges. The game tests the player's determination and resilience as they strive to triumph over their relentless nemesis.

Join the cat on its journey through life and experience the thrill of the chase in this adventure game. With its heart-pounding gameplay and challenging obstacles, this game is sure to test your skills and keep you on the edge of your seat.
Our game is based on the classic T-Rex jumping game built into google chrome. The novel twist is the boss character “Copy Cat” who is a moving obstacle who must be defeated by taking a blow to the head.


Another novel aspect of the game is the entire re-design of the aesthetics and narrative.

# Requirements
### Early Stage Design

Initially we had two main game concepts:

- The T-Rex jumping style platform game - featured on the Google Chrome browser.
- Baba is you - a puzzle based top-down game.

We each voted for our preferred game to develop, results shown below:

After discussing lots of questions and concepts surrounding both ideas, we unanimously decided on developing a jumping style game for several reasons:

Jumping games are fun, intuitive and easy for everyone to play.

Designing many levels for a platform based game could be quite time consuming, in terms of creative and programming resources. A jumping game where the principle is similar throughout was deemed to be the more sensible choice.

There were lots of initial ideas on how to incorporate an interesting narrative for a jumping style game.

### Ideation Process

We started to question the game concept and wondered if it would be engaging enough for players to simply jump over a number of obstacles in order to gain a high score. After a quick **brainstorming session** we arrived at our twist, we would introduce a boss character, “Copy Cat”, Nyan-Cats nemesis who was the biggest obstacle of all. After clearing a certain number of obstacles Nyan-Cat would have to defeat the boss to progress further in the game.

As a result of brainstorming for a twist we actually came up with a second twist, the “fake quit scenario”. The player would not be able to quit the game easily when they died. This twist came with a tagline of “you cannot quit the game of life!”.

At this point we had a game concept with a quirky narrative, a main character and a twist. So we made a paper prototype.

### Paper Prototype

[Video]

The paper prototype involved putting our ideas into practice and seeing how the game actually played. This stage was crucial for identifying any issues or areas for improvement. Some design decisions we made after creating the paper prototype were:

- To represent obstacles as representations of life's obstacles (bills, deadlines, wake up call etc..) and not confuse our game with the aesthetic of By Super Mario world.
- If Nyan-Cat defeated the Copy Cat boss they would be rewarded with a rainbow trail. This would give the player a goal to aim for, aside from just aiming to get a high score.
- We could include the Nyan-Cat theme tune playing on a loop while the game was in play, this is a memorable characteristic associated with the Nyan-Cat meme.

Our ideation process was an iterative and collaborative effort that involved a series of discussions and refinements to arrive at our final concept. By considering various factors such as feasibility and player experience, we were able to create a game that we believe will be enjoyable and engaging for players

### User Stories

- As a player, I want to be able to select a character so that I can choose a different character to play as.
- As a player, I want to select a difficulty so that I can play as a level which suits my ability
- As a player, I want to see instructions so that I know how to play the game.
- As a player, I want to jump over the obstacles so that I can get a higher score.
- As a player, I want to see a game over page when I die so that I know when I have lost the game.
- As a player, I want to be able to play again when the game is over so that I can try to get a higher score next time.
- As a player, I want to see an encouraging message when I lose the game so that I am encouraged to play again.
- As a game player, I want some gratification for completing a hard challenge so that I am encouraged to play more
- As a game player, I want to move forward and backward so that I can dodge obstacles.
- As a player I want to see my score on a leaderboard so that I can compare my achievement against other players

### Functional Requirements

- The system must have a start menu where the user can configure the game settings.
- The system must enable users to select a different character to play as by selecting with the mouse from several character options.
- The system must allow the user to enter a username by typing into a text box.
- The system must have two difficulty option buttons which vary the speed of the game and can be selected with a mouse.
- The system must provide clear written instructions explaining how to use the menu pages and play the game.
- The system must allow the player to move forwards, backwards and jump by using the left right and up arrows on the keyboard.
- The system must allow the user to defeat the boss by jumping on its head.
- The system must have a game over menu where the user can select quit or play again.
- The system must send the user to the beginning of the game the first three times they attempt to quit.
- The system must have user feedback when they defeat the boss with animation and sound effects.
- The system must implement a leaderboard.
