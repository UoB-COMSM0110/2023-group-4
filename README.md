# Introduction
In this game, the player takes on the role of a brave cat that must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach its ultimate goal. With quick reflexes and agility, the cat must leap and dodge its way through daily challenges and unexpected twists of fate.
Throughout its journey, the cat faces new obstacles. However, the cat's greatest challenge is a copycat that threatens to steal its place in life's grand design.

</p>

While the cat's attempts to overcome this challenge may initially result in defeat, quitting is not an option. Every time the player tries to quit, they are met with even greater challenges. The game tests the player's determination and resilience as they strive to triumph over their relentless nemesis.

Join the cat on its journey through life and experience the thrill of the chase in this adventure game. With its heart-pounding gameplay and challenging obstacles, this game is sure to test your skills and keep you on the edge of your seat.
Our game is based on the classic T-Rex jumping game built into google chrome. The novel twist is the boss character “Copy Cat” who is a moving obstacle who must be defeated by taking a blow to the head.


Another novel aspect of the game is the entire re-design of the aesthetics and narrative.The game is designed to evoke a sense of familiarity and continuity, while the obstacles represent metaphorical life challenges, such as peer pressure, bills, loud alarms, and bad luck to mention a few. This creative design approach captivates players and contributes to the overall gaming experience.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, our game design project was an overall success, marked by a strong sense of teamwork, effective communication, and valuable learning experiences. The project's achievements can be attributed to the diverse skill set of our team and our general adaptability. We made consistent progress throughout this project, adapting to ongoing design decisions and working in iterative cycles.

This project introduced us to agile development methods, which proved to be invaluable for team collaboration. The implementation of agile methodologies, such as sprints and Kanban boards greatly influenced our workflow. They encouraged frequent team communication and clear ownership of tasks, both significantly enhanced our team's efficiency and organisation.

However, reflecting on the challenges we faced throughout the project, time management stands out as an area in need of improvement. Although we ultimately accomplished our objectives, a more structured schedule and clear deadlines for each task could have enhanced our efficiency and resource allocation. Better organisation would have allowed us to maximise productivity while reducing stress levels within the team.

This experience has helped us appreciate the challenges of working in a team, making decisions and compromises together. Additionally, our capacity to work under pressure has increased, as we pushed ourselves to meet deadlines and deliver a high-quality product.

To produce our game, we made good use of the powerful Git functions, coding concurrently as a team and ensuring that our work remained synchronised. We appreciated how useful it is to have a detailed log of the project's history and during the development process leant several methods to avoid and overcome merge conflicts.

Our qualitative evaluations of the game gave insightful feedback for making improvements and also highlighted a couple of bugs which were then resolved and further tested, which promoted iterative development of features. The quantitative evaluations provided evidence that there is a significant difference in task load index when the game is played on different difficulty modes, but the usability of the system remains the same. Although we did not implement all of the user stories we had initially planned, the game still functioned well and received positive reception from players.

Furniture work tasks for the game could include the implementation of power-ups and a global leaderboard, which would add more excitement to the game. Another area of the game we could develop further is giving the boss character more functionality, having different themes for each boss encounter for example.
