# Introduction
In this game, the player takes on the role of a brave cat that must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach its ultimate goal. With quick reflexes and agility, the cat must leap and dodge its way through daily challenges and unexpected twists of fate.
Throughout its journey, the cat faces new obstacles. However, the cat's greatest challenge is a copycat that threatens to steal its place in life's grand design.

</p>

While the cat's attempts to overcome this challenge may initially result in defeat, quitting is not an option. Every time the player tries to quit, they are met with even greater challenges. The game tests the player's determination and resilience as they strive to triumph over their relentless nemesis.

Join the cat on its journey through life and experience the thrill of the chase in this adventure game. With its heart-pounding gameplay and challenging obstacles, this game is sure to test your skills and keep you on the edge of your seat.
Our game is based on the classic T-Rex jumping game built into google chrome. The novel twist is the boss character “Copy Cat” who is a moving obstacle who must be defeated by taking a blow to the head.


Another novel aspect of the game is the entire re-design of the aesthetics and narrative.The game is designed to evoke a sense of familiarity and continuity, while the obstacles represent metaphorical life challenges, such as peer pressure, bills, loud alarms, and bad luck to mention a few. This creative design approach captivates players and contributes to the overall gaming experience.
