##  DESIGN OF THE GAME (INTRODUCTION)
"In a world full of challenges and obstacles, one brave cat must journey through life to reach its ultimate goal. Armed with agility and quick reflexes, the cat must leap and dodge its way through the trials and tribulations of existence. From navigating the twists and turns of daily life to overcoming the unexpected twists and turns of fate, this cat will stop at nothing to reach its destiny.

With each leap and bound, the cat is faced with new obstacles - from angry dogs and raging rivers to treacherous cliffs and endless pits. And as the journey grows increasingly difficult, the cat must confront its greatest challenge of all: a cunning copycat that threatens to steal its place in life's grand design.

Despite its best efforts, the cat is always defeated by the copycat. But here's the catch: quitting is not an option. For life is a journey, and quitters never win. Every time the player attempts to quit the game, they are met with even greater challenges, as wave after wave of attacking cats surge forward.

Will the cat ever triumph over its relentless nemesis? Or will it be trapped in this endless cycle of defeat and renewal, forced to face its trials time and time again? Join the cat on its journey through life and experience the thrill of the chase in this heart-pounding adventure that will test the limits of your determination and resilience."

### Ideation process 

The ideation process for our team's game development project involved a series of steps and discussions to arrive at our final concept. It all started with the idea of creating a jumping game, inspired by popular titles such as the T-Rex game found in Google Chrome.
As we brainstormed and discussed possible directions for the game, we eventually landed on the idea of incorporating a meme cat, such as Nyan Cat, as the main character. This idea sparked further creative discussions, as we considered different twists and concepts that could set our game apart from others in the genre.
However, we also considered the feasibility of different ideas, weighing the amount of resources and time required to bring each one to fruition. Through these discussions, we arrived at a clearer picture of why we wanted to create this game and what our ultimate goals were.
As we continued to build upon our idea, we came up with a number of different twists that could potentially make our game stand out. After much discussion and consideration, we finally arrived at our final concept, incorporating elements that we believed would be both entertaining and engaging for players.
One of the key steps in our ideation process was thinking about the flow of the game, including the use case and use story. We wanted to ensure that our game would be easy to understand and play, while still providing a fun and challenging experience for players.
To further refine our idea, we revisited our concept and made sure that everyone on the team was on the same page. This involved simulating how the user would play the game, and considering any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise.
Once we were satisfied with our concept, we moved on to creating a paper prototype of the game to test its viability. This involved putting our ideas into practice and seeing how the game actually played. This stage was crucial in helping us identify any issues or areas for improvement, which we were then able to address and refine.
Finally, we considered the timeline for the project and any details that needed to be addressed, such as the art style and sound effects. By this stage, we had a general idea of what we wanted to achieve and were able to focus on bringing the game to life.
In conclusion, our ideation process was an iterative and collaborative effort that involved a series of discussions and refinements to arrive at our final concept. By considering various factors such as feasibility and player experience, we were able to create a game that we believe will be enjoyable and engaging for players. (445 words)
