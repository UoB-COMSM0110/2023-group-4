## INTRODUCTION

## REQUIREMENTS
Initially we had two main game concepts, <b>the T-Rex jumping style game</b> (featured on the Google Chrome browser) and <b>Baba is you</b>, a puzzle based platform game. So we each voted for out preferred game to develop, results shown below:<br/>
     <img src="/Diagrams/GameVote.png" width="600" height="200"><br>


After discussing lots of questions and concepts surrounding both ideas, ultimately we unanimously decided on developing a jumping style game for several reasons:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, jumping games are fun, intuitive and easy for everyone to play.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we realised that designing many levels for a platform based game could be quite time consuming, in terms of creative and programming resources. A jumping game where the principle is similar throughout was deemed to be the more sensible choice.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we had lots of initial thoughts on how to incorporate an interesting narrative for a jumping style game. Incorporating one of our favourite internet memes (Nyan Cat) and portraying the obstacles as being similar to overcoming adversities in life. Our game would not just be a jumping game but also a “game of life”.<br><br>

<br><br>

Now we knew our game concept, but we were yet to come up with a significant twist for the game. We wondered if it would be engaging enough for players to simply jump over a number of obstacles in order to gain a high score. After a quick brainstorming session we arrived at our twist, we would introduce a new character, “Copy Cat”, Nayancats nemesis who was the biggest obstacle of all. We thought of Copy Cat as being a boss character, after clearing a certain number of obstacles Nyancat would face a much bigger challenge as they would have to defeat this boss before they could proceed any further in this “game of life”. Copy Cat would be defeated if the player manages to jump on Copy Cats head. In order to dodge and battle this boss character we decided that we would also need the character to be able to move left and right as well as jump up and down, therefore our game character would have more freedom of movement than in a traditional jump based game.

<br><br>

As a result of brainstorming for a twist we actually came up with a second twist, the fake quit scenario. The player would not be able to quit the game the first three times they tried to quit after losing. This twist came with a tagline of “you cannot quit the game of life!”.

<br><br>

One of the key steps in our ideation process was thinking about the flow of the game, we continued to refer to our use-case diagram and user stories (which we had started very early on) and updated them to incorporate the new twist. We wanted to ensure that our game would be easy to understand and play, while still providing a fun and challenging experience for the user.

<br><br>

At this point we had a game concept with a quirky narrative, a main character and a twist. We were now in a position to make a paper prototype of how the game was going to work. Below is a video of our initial paper prototype:

T-Rex Game ft. Nyan Cat   
(Game of life! or maybe Game of cat!)

##  DESIGN OF THE GAME (INTRODUCTION)
"In a world full of challenges and obstacles, one brave cat must journey through life to reach its ultimate goal. Armed with agility and quick reflexes, the cat must leap and dodge its way through the trials and tribulations of existence. From navigating the twists and turns of daily life to overcoming the unexpected twists and turns of fate, this cat will stop at nothing to reach its destiny.

With each leap and bound, the cat is faced with new obstacles - from angry dogs and raging rivers to treacherous cliffs and endless pits. And as the journey grows increasingly difficult, the cat must confront its greatest challenge of all: a cunning copycat that threatens to steal its place in life's grand design.

Despite its best efforts, the cat is always defeated by the copycat. But here's the catch: quitting is not an option. For life is a journey, and quitters never win. Every time the player attempts to quit the game, they are met with even greater challenges, as wave after wave of attacking cats surge forward.

Will the cat ever triumph over its relentless nemesis? Or will it be trapped in this endless cycle of defeat and renewal, forced to face its trials time and time again? Join the cat on its journey through life and experience the thrill of the chase in this heart-pounding adventure that will test the limits of your determination and resilience."

## Intro to the game.
- #### The player controls a cat that must navigate through life and overcome various obstacles.

- #### The player must defeat a cunning copycat in order to progress, but the copycat always wins.

- #### Quitting is not an option, as quitting is seen as a failure in life.

- #### Every time the player attempts to quit the game, they are met with even greater challenges in the form of attacking cats.

- #### The player is trapped in an endless cycle of defeat and renewal, forced to face the trials and obstacles of life time and time again.

- #### The game tests the player's determination and resilience, and presents a metaphor for the challenges and obstacles of life.

-  #### Users presses space to start the game;
-  #### Users use left and right and space to choose the characters and difficulties. (By default is the first cat)
-  #### Users can see obstacles coming up randomly. 
-  #### Users use space to control the character to jump over obstacles;
-  #### Users see the score and level; 
-  #### Users can get one score once jump over the obstacles;

### Ideation process 

The ideation process for our team's game development project involved a series of steps and discussions to arrive at our final concept. It all started with the idea of creating a jumping game, inspired by popular titles such as the T-Rex game found in Google Chrome.
As we brainstormed and discussed possible directions for the game, we eventually landed on the idea of incorporating a meme cat, such as Nyan Cat, as the main character. This idea sparked further creative discussions, as we considered different twists and concepts that could set our game apart from others in the genre.
However, we also considered the feasibility of different ideas, weighing the amount of resources and time required to bring each one to fruition. Through these discussions, we arrived at a clearer picture of why we wanted to create this game and what our ultimate goals were.
As we continued to build upon our idea, we came up with a number of different twists that could potentially make our game stand out. After much discussion and consideration, we finally arrived at our final concept, incorporating elements that we believed would be both entertaining and engaging for players.
One of the key steps in our ideation process was thinking about the flow of the game, including the use case and use story. We wanted to ensure that our game would be easy to understand and play, while still providing a fun and challenging experience for players.
To further refine our idea, we revisited our concept and made sure that everyone on the team was on the same page. This involved simulating how the user would play the game, and considering any potential obstacles or challenges that may arise.
Once we were satisfied with our concept, we moved on to creating a paper prototype of the game to test its viability. This involved putting our ideas into practice and seeing how the game actually played. This stage was crucial in helping us identify any issues or areas for improvement, which we were then able to address and refine.
Finally, we considered the timeline for the project and any details that needed to be addressed, such as the art style and sound effects. By this stage, we had a general idea of what we wanted to achieve and were able to focus on bringing the game to life.
In conclusion, our ideation process was an iterative and collaborative effort that involved a series of discussions and refinements to arrive at our final concept. By considering various factors such as feasibility and player experience, we were able to create a game that we believe will be enjoyable and engaging for players. (445 words)
